# Week 9: Surf's Up
Module 9: Exploring Weather Data
Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

Project Purpose: 

The purpose of this project is to determine temperatures in Hawaii in consideration of creating a prospective business to be called “Surf n’ Shake”.  The business plan calls for the sale/rental of surf boards while retailing ice cream shakes to local residents and tourists. We are tasked with gathering annual temperature data such that it can be determined that the business can be run throughout the entire year. This data will be presented to possible investors in a clear and concise fashion. 

Summary Statistics: Temperature Analyzation

Our analysis consisted of taking sample temperature statistics from December and June as a comparison from a number of locations. The June period produced 1700 records while the December period detailed 1517 as evidenced by the following charts. We feel that these records produced a reasonable sampling of temperatures.

A more detailed comparison shows that the average temperature in June was about 75 degrees while in December it was 71.  While the low temperature in December was 8 degrees lower than in June it should not be viewed as a determining factor. 

 Conclusions/Other Considerations
 
 Based on the temperature data as presented, there is not enough of a difference in temperature between the June and December periods to suggest that the Surf n’ Shake business would be impacted to a large degree. Thus, the viability of year round operations is possible. 
 
 However, there are other considerations that should be considered in a more detailed analysis:

1. Severe weather: With the advent of more extreme weather due to climate change, additional consideration should be given to more serious weather factors such as hurricanes or tropical storms.

Questions such as “ Have the incidence of these type of storms increased over the recent years?” should be looked into. 

2. Tourist Industry: A great deal of business should result from tourists visiting the Hawaiian Islands. What factors should be taken into account in a determination of how many tourists will (or will not) visit the islands? Now that the effect of the pandemic has been reduced, what other measures can be taken to increase tourist traffic to the business.
